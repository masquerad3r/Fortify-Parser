# Fortify Parser
## Overview
The Fortify parser has been made to facilitate faster reporting during penetration testing exercises. This helps the pentesters focus more on the testing aspect of their projects and reduces the cumbersome and repetitive task of making customized client reports.

This python script simply takes **XML report** generated by Fortify as command line argument.

## Information Extracted from XML Report
* Security Risk
* Severity
* Description
* Source File Name
* Source File Path
* Source Line Number
* Sink File Name
* Sink File Path
* Sink Line Number
* Remarks

The extracted information is then sorted based on severity, with most critical issues listed on top and the lower risk issues listed at the bottom.

## Running the tool
Run the command to generate the excel report:
```
python Fortify_parser.py <xml file name>
```

## Screenshot
**NOTE:** The below screenshot is just for demonstration purpose, showing the sorted output with color codes expressing levels of severity.
